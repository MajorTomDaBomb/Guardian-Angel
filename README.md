A mobile social engineering defense app that utilizes AI to screen live calls and suspends the call if necessary to protect the user.
I'm a university student that's studying computer science with a focus on cyber operations. The reason I want to create this app is to protect people like my grandparents who don't have tech skills and find it difficult to detect cyber fraud on their own. By utilizing an AI model to screen their live calls and protect them if necessary, I hope to give them some peace of mind when using the devices they enjoy so much.
